# Final Project

#### English 4

## Overview

Your task as you approach the end of your secondary school term is to create a book that captures who you are right now. This book will be called a "Life Book", and it's intention is to be a collection of images and reflections that show the reader what you value, what you've been through, and what drives you as a human being. Your intended audience is your future self: I hope to return these to you before graduation that you may keep them and, maybe, rediscover yourself later in life.

## Guidelines

To create this Life Book, do the following:

- Collect twenty images of things, people, places, or moments important to you, either right now or over the course of your life. They must be original, however: no generic internet pictures.
- Label each image with a brief, one-sentence description.
- In no fewer than 50 words each, tell the story of the picture. Consider what the picture *doesn't* tell you. Provide some history, background, or interesting insights.
- Mount or present the images and commentary in a physical book or folder. Electronic submissions are unacceptable. The physical artifact should be both carefully made and durable.
- Submit your book as early as you like, but no later than the last day of senior exams. I will return them to you graded within the day. No work will be accepted after the last day of senior exams (I will accept books on the exam make-up day in the case of an excused absence on the last senior exam day).
- This is meant to be a positive, reflective, meaningful experience for you as you graduate: the more you engage and have fun with this, the more important it will become to you. I encourage you to take this very seriously.

Good luck!
